# Classic Skins

The information, skin files, etc within this folder are related to 'classic' aka Winamp 2.x skins.

These skins are of a fixed format and based around simply defined bitmap images to form the Winamp UI. They use a relatively low amount of memory due to the constrained design and the small window sizes (against modern day UI expectations).
